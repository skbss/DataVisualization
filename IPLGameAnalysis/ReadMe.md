The purpose of this project is to build interactive dashboard of IPL (Indian Premier League) Game Statistics using Tableau. 

The final dashboard can be broken down into several categories and sub-categories. 
1. Match Statistics

Toss outcome vs Match outcome (for each Ground/Venue)
Biggest wins (by runs and by wicket)
Highest totals (across all the seasons)
 

2. Player Statistics

Orange Cap contenders (The batsmen who have scored the maximum number of runs in a particular season)
Purple Cap contenders (The bowlers who have taken the maximum number of wickets in a particular season)
Batsmen who have hit the most number of fours and sixes (per season and overall)

3. Team Statistics

Season-wise team performance (wins vs losses)
Win %age ( home vs away)
